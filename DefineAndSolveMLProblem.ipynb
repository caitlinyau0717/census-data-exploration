This is a supervised learning problem that utilizes classification as it is grouping people based on whether they made less than or equal to 50k or if they make more than 50k. My features will be every other column but my label. This is an important problem because it can be used to predict how much one makes so if a bank wants to predict if someone is capable of a loan or credit or if a college wants to predict how much aid one recieves, etc., then this will be useful.

I decided that for my data preparation I will address missingness, replace outliers, replace the name of fnlwgt, and one-hot encode gender, race, workclass, education, occupation, and relationship. I already implemented them above. I will use a Logistic Regression model because it is a simple linear model well suited for classification problems such as this one. I'm going to split the data set into its X(label) and y(features), transform the data to improve model performance, and then split them into test and train sets. Then ill fit the model to the logistic regression model and make predictions. To evaluate, i'll test the accuracy score and make a confusion matrix. "
